**#Animal and Dog Class Implementation
****Overview
This C++ program demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts such as inheritance and polymorphism through the creation of an Animal class and a derived Dog class. The Dog class inherits from the Animal class and adds additional functionality specific to dogs. The program allows you to create generic animals and dogs, each of which can make a sound, with dogs having an extra function to "bark".

Key Features:
Animal Class: The base class represents a generic animal with a name and a makeSound() method to print a generic animal sound.
Dog Class: A derived class that represents a dog, which inherits from the Animal class and adds a bark() method to display a dog's breed-specific behavior.
Constructor Inheritance: The Dog class uses the constructor of the Animal class to initialize the dog's name and then adds a breed-specific feature.
